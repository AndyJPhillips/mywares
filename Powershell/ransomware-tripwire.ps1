.Synopsis
   This script monitors 'tripwire' files to see if they have been renamed, deleted or modified by a potential ransomware virus
.DESCRIPTION
   You should run this script as a service on a suitable Windows server. 
   It will take a set (array) of tripwire files and compare those to reference (read-only) files to make sure the files match, i.e. to make sure the tripwire files haven't been modified
   If the script either:
   
   - cannot access the tripwire or reference files
   OR
   - detects the tripwire and reference files are different
   
   It will alert the appropriate IT Support team(s)
